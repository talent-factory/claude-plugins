# Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document for new features or products.

## Context

You are helping create a professional PRD that clearly defines product requirements, success metrics, and implementation details.

## PRD Template Structure

```markdown
# [Product/Feature Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
Brief description of the product/feature and its purpose.

### Problem Statement
What problem are we solving? Why now?

### Target Users
Who will use this? What are their characteristics?

### Success Metrics
How will we measure success?
- Metric 1: [e.g., 20% increase in user engagement]
- Metric 2: [e.g., Reduce task completion time by 30%]
- Metric 3: [e.g., 500 active users in first month]

## 2. User Stories

### Primary User Stories
As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

### Secondary User Stories
Additional user stories for edge cases or secondary users.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Feature 1**
   - Description
   - User interaction
   - Expected behavior

2. **Feature 2**
   - Description
   - User interaction
   - Expected behavior

### Optional Features (Nice to Have)
Features that would enhance the product but aren't critical for v1.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Response time requirements
- Load capacity
- Scalability needs

### Security
- Authentication requirements
- Data protection
- Privacy considerations

### Usability
- Accessibility standards
- Browser/device support
- Internationalization needs

### Reliability

- Data backup/recovery

## 5. User Interface

### Design Principles
Key principles guiding the UI/UX design

### Wireframes/Mockups
Description or links to design assets

### User Flow
Step-by-step user journey through the feature

## 6. Technical Considerations

### Architecture
High-level technical approach

### Dependencies
- External services
- Internal systems
- Third-party libraries

### Data Model
Key data structures and relationships

### API Contracts
Expected API endpoints and data formats

## 7. Implementation Plan

### Phases
**Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)**
- Core infrastructure
- Basic functionality

**Phase 2: Enhancement (2 weeks)**
- Additional features
- Refinements

**Phase 3: Polish (1 week)**
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization

### Milestones
1. Milestone 1: [Date]
2. Milestone 2: [Date]
3. Launch: [Date]

### Dependencies & Blockers
- Dependency 1
- Dependency 2

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High | Medium | Mitigation strategy |
| Risk 2 | Medium | High | Mitigation strategy |

## 9. Success Criteria

### Launch Criteria
What must be true before we can launch?
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

### Post-Launch Metrics
How will we measure success after launch?
- Metric 1: [Target]
- Metric 2: [Target]

## 10. Open Questions

- Question 1: [Status]
- Question 2: [Status]

## 11. Appendix

### Research & References
Links to relevant research, competitor analysis, user feedback

### Glossary
Definition of key terms

### Revision History
| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | [Date] | [Author] | Initial draft |
```

## Workflow

1. **Gather Information**
   - Interview stakeholders
   - Research user needs
   - Analyze competitors
   - Review existing data

2. **Structure Content**
   - Start with executive summary
   - Define clear user stories
   - Detail requirements
   - Plan implementation

3. **Review & Iterate**
   - Get stakeholder feedback
   - Refine based on input
   - Validate assumptions
   - Update metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
   - Use concrete examples
   - Define measurable metrics
   - Set clear acceptance criteria

2. **Stay Focused**
   - Limit scope to one feature/product
   - Defer nice-to-haves
   - Prioritize ruthlessly

3. **Think User-First**
   - Start with user problems
   - Validate with user research
   - Focus on user value

4. **Make it Actionable**
   - Clear next steps
   - Defined ownership
   - Realistic timelines

## Interactive Mode

Ask the user:
1. What product/feature are we documenting?
2. What problem does it solve?
3. Who are the target users?
4. What are the key requirements?
5. What are the success metrics?
6. What is the timeline?

Then generate the PRD structure and guide them through filling it out.

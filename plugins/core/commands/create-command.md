# Create New Command

Create a new command that follows the existing patterns and organizational structure in this project.

## ANALYZE EXISTING COMMANDS

1. First study the existing commands in the `.claude/commands/` directory to understand:
   - Common patterns and structures
   - Naming conventions
   - Documentation styles
   - Command organization

2. Use MCP tools to explore the codebase and understand:
   - Project structure
   - Existing functionality
   - Code patterns
   - Dependencies

## UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST

1. Analyze the user request to determine:
   - Purpose and functionality of the command
   - Which category it belongs to
   - Similar existing commands for reference
   - Required inputs and outputs

## SELECT MATCHING PATTERNS

1. Based on your analysis, select the most appropriate pattern:
   - Simple execution commands
   - File generation commands
   - Analysis and report commands
   - Multi-step workflow commands

## PLAN SUPPORTING RESOURCES

1. Consider which supporting resources might be needed:
   - Templates or example files
   - Configuration files
   - Documentation updates
   - Related commands that could work together

## CREATE COMMAND

1. Write the command following these guidelines:
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Add comprehensive instructions
   - Follow existing formatting patterns
   - Include appropriate examples
   - Consider error handling

## HUMAN REVIEW

1. Present your analysis and the proposed command to the human for review before implementation, including:
   - Command purpose and location
   - Key patterns you are following
   - Assumptions you are making
   - Questions about specific requirements
